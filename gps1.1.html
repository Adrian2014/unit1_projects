     <p>
     	&nbsp;&nbsp; Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
     </p>
     <p>
     	&nbsp;&nbsp; While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

     <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; Economics: Pairs spend about 15% more time on programs than individuals. However, the resulting code has about 15% fewer defects. Along with code development time, other factors like field support costs and quality assurance also affect the expenses. IBM reported spending about $250 million repairing and reinstalling fixes to 30,000 customer-reported problems. Pair programming significantly reduces these expenses by reducing the defects in the programs.
