<header>Wireframing for Unit 1</header>
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first website I chose to wireframe is the BBC News homepage.  I like reading BBC news for their reporting on the United States of America because, for the most part, the reporters do not have the American party-line bias.  They do a decent job of reporting how America's actions are viewed by people around the world.They are not the best when it comes to the coverage of the middle east however, and are very bias when it comes to European matters.</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second website I chose to wireframe is Craigslist Rants and Raves.  This website is one of my guilty pleasures.  Although it can be filthy at times, it is a great way to see what the lowwest common denominator is thinking.  When I was a history major I learned that the best way to see the values of a society is to read the diaries of the lower end of the socio-economic hierarchy.  It is their values and beliefs that help form mainstream society, and therefore mainstream media.  And although anyone can post to Craigslist Rants and Raves, it appears that it is mostly the uneducated that choose to let their views be known.</b>
